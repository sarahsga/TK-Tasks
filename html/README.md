## How to do HTML Tasks?
* You only need HTML to complete these tasks.
* No CSS required.

Watch the [Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/bKzNhlM_E4A) on how to do HTML tasks.

You will be given a concept / a screenshot / an existing website. Your job is to identify HTML elements in it and create a web page yourself using HTML only.

### How are the tasks named?
Each task is named using the format `number-taskname`. The number signifies task difficulty on a scale of 10. So `05-sometask` will be more difficult than `02-anothertask`.
